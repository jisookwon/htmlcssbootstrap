<p1>HTML is not a programming language;
    it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
    HTML consists of a series of elements,
    which you use to enclose,
    or wrap,
    different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
    or act a certain way.
    The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
    can italicize words,
    can make the font bigger or smaller,
    and so on.
    For example, take the following line of content:</p1>
</body>
</html>
